# Low-cost engineering preparation

A village boy's guide to the engineering preparation.

Here is a list of resources in very simple english that can help students who:
- Can understand simple english
- Want to prepare for getting into great engineering colleges like IIT, IIIT, NIT, BITS.
- Don't have the financial resources to join coaching.
- Don't have broadband and computer access.

If you have th financial resources to join coaching then I **highly** recommend doing that.

If you have broadband and computer access then there are many resources you can use such as http://khanacademy.org

## How to use this guide?

Books are your best friends. Many school teachers are not knowledgeable. They teach wrong concepts to bright students. Students get confused and join coaching. But everyone cannot join coaching. So what should they do? Don't worry. If you know the right books then you can still prepare for engineering and get into good colleges.

I am a student at IIT Kharagpur. I am going to guide you about what books are good. I will also tell you how to make a study plan based on which class you are in. You do not need to read all the chapters in this guide. Just choose one chapter according to which class yo are in and follow the instructions. 


## If you are in class 11th.
This is the perfect time to start preparing for JEE.
